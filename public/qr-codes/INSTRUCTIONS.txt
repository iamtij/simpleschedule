QR CODE IMAGES SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

The 404 errors you're seeing are EXPECTED because the QR code image files 
haven't been uploaded yet.

ERROR EXPLANATION:
------------------
The browser is trying to load:
- http://localhost:3000/qr-codes/gcash-monthly-499.jpg (404 - Not Found)
- http://localhost:3000/qr-codes/gcash-yearly-4788.png (404 - Not Found)

This is normal until you add the actual image files.

HOW TO FIX:
-----------
1. Take screenshots or save your GCash QR code images
2. Save them with these EXACT filenames:
   - gcash-monthly-499.jpg (for PHP 499 monthly plan)
   - gcash-yearly-4788.png (for PHP 4,788 yearly plan)

3. Copy both image files to this directory:
   /Users/admin/SimpleSchedule/public/qr-codes/

4. The files should be:
   - JPG or JPEG format
   - High enough resolution to be scannable (at least 500x500 pixels)
   - Named exactly as shown above

5. After uploading, restart your server (if needed) and refresh the page.
   The 404 errors will disappear and the QR codes will display properly.

NOTE: These errors won't break the application - they just mean the images
      aren't showing yet. Once you upload the files, everything will work!
