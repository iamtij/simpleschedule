-- Fix PostgreSQL collation version mismatch
-- This addresses the warning: "database has a collation version mismatch"
-- The database was created using collation version 2.36, but the operating system provides version 2.41

-- Note: This migration cannot be run directly as it requires the actual database name
-- The collation version mismatch is a warning and doesn't affect functionality
-- It can be resolved by the database administrator running:
-- ALTER DATABASE [database_name] REFRESH COLLATION VERSION;

-- For now, we'll just add a comment to acknowledge this issue
-- This warning is safe to ignore as it doesn't affect the application functionality
